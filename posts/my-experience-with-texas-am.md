Have you ever wondered what it would be like to attend Texas A&M University?  In this article, I'll go over the pros the cons of attending of the largest university in Texas. I'll also talk generally about attending college in the US, and if it's still worth the investment. 

# A Quick Summary 
First, I want to give a quick summary of the school.  Texas Agriculture and Mechanics University is an old, tradional university that was formally an all-male military academy until the 1960's.  It's main campus is in College Station which is the largest "college town" in the US.  It's generally considered the second best (or the best, if you ask an aggie) public university in Texas and is typically ranked somewhere between the 50-70th best college in the US.  The following are the college's specialities:

| Discipline/Major | National Ranking   | % Of Student Body
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Agricultural/Animal/Plant/Veterinary Science   | ~5th | ~8% |
| Engineering | ~12th | ~16% |
| Business, Management, Marketing | ~30th | ~16% |
| Biological and Biomedical Sciences | ~75th | ~8% | 

I won't be going into all of the specific stats for A&M because you can look up everything you need online, but the point I'm making is *it's a good school*.  Telling somebody you studied some form of science at Texas A&M gives you the clout and prestige that you're paying for when you attend a 4 year university.  I also have friends that studied education, nursing, communication, and psychology at A&M and they all seemed happy with the degrees and the level of education they received.  

## The Pros
### Prestigous Degree and Networking Opportunities
I can say without a doubt that getting a STEM degree from Texas A&M will open doors for you.  The man who hired me for my first software job was an aggie, and even though I bombed the technical interview he took a chance to train me because he liked me.  I've had instant rapport with other people I've worked with over the years simply because we went to the same school. 

### Public Transportation
Texas A&M boasts the largest campus in Texas and the 9th largest in the US, so having access to a reliable transportation system was a big deal while I was going to school there.  The streets are fairly bike friendly, but the true strength was the busses.  A&M has an incredible bus network that ferries thousands of students all across College Station for free.  This is a big deal, because (like most college campuses) driving and parking close to your classes is an absolute nightmare.

### Decent Amount of Foreign Exchange Students
Everybody may not agree with me on this one, but I enjoyed going to school with people from outside the states.  I spent most of my life up to that point living in a small rural town, so getting to make friends with people from different countries and cultures was enlightning.  

## The Cons
### Research Professors Cannot Teach
The engineering program at A&M is **hard**. "55 percent of students who come into freshman engineering graduate with an engineering degree". [[Source]](https://theeagle.com/news/local/texas-a-m-crafting-a-bigger-better-engineering-school/article_6bfdda0a-8da6-5172-80bf-77114ec7108e.html)  The program is made even harder when most of the professors are researchers by trade and not educators. See, to hold a serious research position at A&M you are [required to teach a certain amount.](https://dof.tamu.edu/dof/media/DOF-Media/Documents/DOF%20Guidelines/Faculty-Title-Guidelines-(Updated-2013).pdf)  

This means that A&M brings in these qualified, brilliant scientists from all over the world to conduct thier research then tells them, *"Oh by the way, to hold a research position here, you'll need to teach these undergrads the basics with whatever free-time you have."* To be clear, teaching is not these people's primary responsibility or even necessarily in thier skillset.  Most of my engineering lectures at A&M involved a professor speaking broken english or muttering along with an outdated powerpoint into a wall for an hour.  I even had one guy have a graduate student come teach the entire class for him.  

To be faaaiiirrrr... the handful of professors that *were* actually interested in teaching were an absolute delight to learn from, in contrast. That said, I would say ~70-80% of the engineering professors at A&M **cannot** teach, have **no interest** in teaching, and treat undergrad students as an annoying obstacle to thier research.

### Any Color You Like, As Long As It's Maroon
While the college of engineering had a healthy international community, the school was seriously lacking in the diversity department.  I remember having a conversion in 2011 with one of my buddies in high school.  He had excellent grades, so I asked him if he was considering attending A&M or University of Texas?  (The two best public colleges in Texas)

His response was laughing then a resounding *absolutely not* either of those schools. "Black folk don't go to A&M" were his exact words.  He was interesed in a sister-campus to A&M called Prairie View where he felt he would be more welcome.  I thought it was a strange comment at the time, but while attending A&M I can't remember meeting a single engineering student that was African American.  I became close friends with several international students from Africa, but most of the student body were white middle class kids like me.

### The Football Death Cult
Aggies love football, so if you're planning on attending Texas A&M be prepared to love going to the games or prepare to be an outcast. (Not exaggarating, aggies have a special term for students that don't attend the games)
Personally, I never cared for watching sports so I was branded as a 2 percenter. (Because supposedly 2% of the student body don't attend the games)
Looking at A&M's football culture from the outside gives you a unique perspecive.  The student body learn chants, group dances, and hand signs to perform in the stands during the game.  The only time I remember doing these was at orientation and at graduation, and I fumbled miserably during both.

## Is Attending College in the US Even Worth it Anymore?
With higher education prices skyrocketing, exorbitant amounts of student debt, and the professional landscape shifting to online/remote work I find myself asking if it was all worth it.  While having a four year degree has helped me meet the minimum requirement for some jobs, I've never officially worked as an electrical engineer.  Many of the math and computer classes I took helped me learn other things faster, but I don't find myself using any of the knowledge I learned at A&M on a regular basis.  In fact, several of my peers in the software world don't even have a bachelor's degree.  So was it worth it?  

For me personally, I would say going to A&M was *barely* worth the $45,000 and two and a half year investment. (~$25k tuition and ~$20k living expenses) I attended a junior college on a scholarship to get my basics out of the way first, so I only spent my Junior and Senior years at A&M.  I cannot imagine going for four years and accumulating $100k in debt just to get a degree.  All of that said, I had a good idea of what I wanted to study and I got out what I put into college.  College helped me land jobs and built my confidence, so it was worth $45k to me.  
 
If I could go back in time and do it all again with hindsight, I would get the cheapest and easiest undergraduate degree possible.  The prestige and recognition of a big school is not worth the price tag, full stop.  You can save tens of thousands of dollars and years of your time attending a cheap school or even a nice school's online program. (*NOT* University of Phoenix or ITT Tech) **DISCLAIMER: Don't waste your time with a meme schools that have a negative reputation.**

At the end of the day, you don't learn job skills from University and are there to have fun and check off the "I have a degree" box.  So **get a degree from an ok school for as cheap and as fast as possible**. Then you can use the money you saved to travel, learn actual marketable skills, or obtain a master's degree.  All three of which will serve you better in an job interview than spending an extra year and going into debt to get an aggie ring.

## TLDR
In conclusion, I don't regret going to A&M. My college experience was a means to an end to get a degree.  I honestly didn't become interested in developing myself or learning until *after* college. Nevertheless, A&M is a good school and the brand recognition paid off in my case.  Do the math, figure out if college is right for you.
