### A Brutal Fantasy Series:
Do you like getting kicked in the face?  Do you enjoy having your heart ripped out and stomped on in front of you?  Are you a masochist and enjoy inflicting pain on yourself?  If so, this gritty, brutal fantasy epic may be for you.

This is the first series I’ve ever read that made me *feel* pain while reading it.  The story will make your jaw drop in disbelief and shock.  In fact, several times while reading this series, I had to set the book back on the shelf and take a break out of utter disgust and contempt. 

These books will cause you physical suffering and mental shock. That said, I cannot recommend them enough.

### A Quick Summary Without Spoilers
The Union is slipping towards war with the fanatical Gurkish empire. Instead of preparing, Union leaders and politicians are headbutting each other into a bloody pulp.  A mysterious magi (magician) appears claiming to be an ancient Union hero.  Can this mysterious magi and his crazed quest save the Union?


## The Good
The quirky characters and gritty plot are what make the First Law Trilogy shine. Let’s start with the characters.

### The Characters
The story flip flops between six distinct main characters whose paths intersect and criss-cross. 
All of these characters are interesting, deep, and relatable.  They are also severely flawed, insecure, and constantly fail and undermine their own goals.  You will simultaneously love the characters while also shouting “WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, YOU IDIOT?!” at the pages.  Their actions make perfect sense in the context of the plot and their development, but you can’t help but grind your teeth at what incompetent fuck-ups they are. Maybe their failures make them more relatable, because I came away from with a deep love and respect for the cast Abercrombie created.


### The Plot
At a glance, the plot is fairly simple and straight-forward.  Abercrombie doesn’t use prophecies, flashbacks, or other devices to tell his story for him.  The world is built and described, in order, through character dialog and clues. 
On the shallow surface, the story involves standard fantasy elements such as a war between kingdoms, adventures for magic items, and saucy love affairs. However, each element of the story has a deep and dark side that makes it feel uncomfortably realistic.  For example, in the main adventure our characters find themselves in a standard battle with a dozen bandits.  One of our main characters stupidly flounders, is maimed, and nearly killed as a result.  The character goes the rest of the story with a disfigured face and a distinct fear of combat from said trauma.  The hero developing into a coward is just one example of the uncomfortable realism I'm talking about.

This kind of realism permeates every aspect of Abercrombie’s storytelling.  Even though the story takes place in a make-believe land with magic and demons, you eventually get the feeling that it could all be real.  This, paired with the tension created by the deeply flawed characters keep the story unpredictable and fresh.


## The Bad and the Ugly
I don’t have many serious complaints about the trilogy.  The story involves some intricate politics that I feel detract a *bit* from the main narrative, but are necessary for some of the major plot twists.  Additionally, the story includes strong explicit elements that feel over the top and unnecessary. 

### Political Intrigue
A main theme of the story is there is no good or evil, only perspective.  Abercrombie goes to length to demonstrate this by showing the motivation and background for each political faction. This way, readers can see that there are reasons that “the villains” commit atrocities.  This is an interesting theme and creates a lot of the tension and “pain” in the story.

However, typically spending time detailing politics is not exciting to read.  While I think Abercrombie does a good job of pacing the story, the detail into every faction and side character's reasoning became a bit tedious. 

### Sex and Violence
This story is gory and extremely violent. To put it into perspective, watch Game of Thrones and multiply the violence by x3.  Personally, I didn’t have a problem with the story's brutality, but I also don’t feel that over-the-top violence adds anything of value.  I am neutral about it. That said, anyone with a weak stomach should stay away from these books.

Similarly, I felt the sex scenes were over the top.  I often listened to the audiobooks through a speaker on my back porch, so the borderline smut scenes had me blushing as my neighbors would walk by.  Again, I think using explicit content is an interesting way to build your characters and make the story seem real. But being subtle with these things can accomplish the same goal without making readers feel uncomfortable. (Maybe Joe wants us to be uncomfortable?)

## Aside: But Wait There's More!
There is also a second trilogy out that takes place ~30 years after The First Law Trilogy and includes some of the characters from The First Law. I believe the second trilogy, and the novellas in-between, are at least as strong as The First Law.     


## In conclusion
The First Law Trilogy turned out to be one of the best fantasy series I’ve ever read.  It's brutal, exciting, and will make you question your interest in literature. If you can stomach violet and racy stories, these books will definitely be worth your time.
