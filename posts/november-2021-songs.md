# Real Quick
I recently stumbled upon this Canadian R&B producer/artist KAYTRANADA.  Holy moly, he's good!  If you haven't heard of him DEFINITELY check out his stuff.

Also, I found a REALLY cool way to check your most played songs on spotify. (Without waiting for Spotify to generate a yearly playlist for you.) [statsforspotify.com](https://www.statsforspotify.com/) Link your spotify account (Totally safe, uses OAuth) and it shows your top tracks in the past 4 weeks, 6 months, and all time.  Although I have no affiliation with the site, it's a cool web app and happens to be super helpful when making these monthly posts.
