If you haven't listened to Queens of the Stone Age's album: "...Like Clockwork" it is the perfect amalgamation of spooky vibes and hard rock.

Also, I went down a research rabbit-hole to learn that Led Zeppelin stole many of their top hits.  Don't believe me?  I made a playlist that compares each Zeppelin song to its *"inspiration".*  Some are definitely loose interpretations, while others are blatant copies.
