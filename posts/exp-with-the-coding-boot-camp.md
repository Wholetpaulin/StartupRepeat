# Preface from 2021 Paul
I wrote [this article](https://medium.com/@Wholetpaulin/pauls-experience-with-the-coding-boot-camp-at-ut-austin-e1cb1a718733) at the end of 2017 just before officially starting my software career.  I've had several people reach out since then and ask me several variations of "Is this right for me?".  I've attached a FAQ at the end of the article summarizing these questions and my answers to them. 

PS: There's a TLDR at the end of the article.

# The original medium article from three years ago: (12/21/2017)
Three months ago I quit my day job and enrolled full-time at The Coding Boot Camp at UT Austin. Yesterday, I graduated and received my certificate of completion and I wanted to share the great experience I had with anyone curious about this new and upcoming coding crash course.

For those unfamiliar with this kind of course, a coding boot camp is a training courses that teaches students the fundamentals needed to become immediately employable in some field of programming. The classes are generally 3–6 months long, require at least 40 hours of your week, and cost anywhere between $10,000 and $20,000. For most people, these courses help transition from a non-computer science career to a programming-heavy career.

The Coding Boot Camp at UT Austin is a new contender in the coding boot camp sphere, so when I enrolled the reviews were few and far between. I was extremely skeptical at first, because many other coding boot camps have been getting lots of negative attention from the tech community. Horror stories of boot camp graduates not being hired, bashing blog posts from former unhappy students, and even some of the top coding boot camps shutting down. After doing a ton of research, I bit the bullet and decided on the Coding Boot Camp at UT Austin.

I chose this particular camp because it was affordable ($11,000) and it was in Austin, so I wouldn’t have to relocate to attend. I’ve always fantasized about creating applications, and kept a running list of all my app and business ideas. This was something I always knew I wanted to do, but never had the skills or any idea how to get started. This boot camp provided everything I needed and more.

I remember about two months into the course thinking, “I’ve already learned so much, I feel like I’ve already gotten my money’s worth from this class.” I cannot express how fantastic this course was. I learned more practical, hands-on knowledge in 3 months than I did from 4 years of university. I graduated with a bachelor’s of Electrical Engineering from Texas A&M, so I had some prior programming knowledge coming into the boot camp. Most of that prior knowledge was theoretical and abstract. Prior to taking this course, I had no idea how to create functional application.

Now I’m confident I can contribute real-world skills to a team or project. Here are just a few of the topics we learned:

- HTML5
- Git
- CSS3
- Twitter Bootstrap
- Javascript (So much Javascript!)
- jQuery
- RESTful APIs and using AJAX
- Firebase
- Node.js
- mySQL
- MongoDB
- Express.js and Handlebars
- Custom ORM, Sequelize, and Mongoose
- Testing
- React
- React Native
- Php and Laravel
- Authentication using Passport.js
- Intro to Computer Science and Algorithms

What all that fancy jargon translates to is we learned how to create every aspect of building a website. From styling and design, to complex login in systems, and even creating and hosting the site on our own server.
The class itself felt like a bit like a fast paced, college level course that lasted all day. The biggest difference was the teaching style. The instructor would lecture for 10–20 minutes, then we would do a 10 minute hands-on activity with the technology lectured about. I absolutely loved this format, because it forces you to get involved and really understand what you’re learning about.

Twice a week we were assigned homework assignments to solidify those concepts. The homework would take about 10 hours on average to complete. We would receive grades and comments on the homework, but only as a means for us to improve. The grading dynamic was very different than a conventional classroom, which I thought was a good thing. The homework was graded by the teacher assistants, which were usually top former students. Grades were only there as a means to provide feedback, and not to weed out or fail students. Unless you were failing to even attempt the homework, you would graduate and receive a certificate.

On top of the homework assignments, there were three group projects. Teams of four would use the skills learned in class to create functional web applications. For example, my first group project was an application that located nearby bars to your local gym. The instructor would give the teams requirements to meet, and the teams had free reign on what to create.

The last kind of assignment was career homework. These were usually simple things like updating your LinkedIn or GitHub profile. The boot camp continues to provide career support even after the course ends, so the usefulness of this service remains to be seen.

Part of the motivation for taking this class was to help me find a career in the tech industry. After graduating from Texas A&M University, I remained unemployed for months. I applied for over 200 jobs after school, and only landed 6–7 interviews. I eventually took one of those jobs in an unrelated field, and quickly became unhappy. Luckily, the market for web developer jobs is larger and more forgiving than entry-level engineering positions. Since starting this course, I’ve gotten promising interviews from 5 out of the 33 web developer positions I applied for.

My advice to anyone thinking of attending this boot camp would be don’t attend a coding boot camp unless you are hungry and passionate to learn programming. This course does not guarantee a tech job after graduation, and is extremely difficult. Several of my fellow classmates ran out of steam early, and it is because they signed up for the wrong reasons. The only guarantee for a great career is a genuine interest and passion to create awesome programs. I didn’t have that interest for electrical engineering, and I had a difficult time finding a job as a result. Also, future students should get some programming practice before starting this course. There are tons of free material to get started online, and coming in with some prior knowledge will pay off ten fold.

**TLDR;** In conclusion, attending The Coding Boot Camp at UT Austin was one of the best decisions I’ve made in my life. I’m excited I get to pursue my personal passion, and grateful I had the opportunity to attend such a fabulous program.

# FAQ (From the past three years):

**Q:** Did this bootcamp help you land interviews? How did you manage to overcome the lack of experience in your applications?

>**A:** Did bootcamp the bootcamp help me land interviews? Yes and no..

>It provided me with the knowledge to pass a phone interview, nail the take home interview test, and stumble through the in-person interview that became my first coding job. This was two weeks out of the bootcamp. I felt a lot like you, it’s REALLY hard to self teach without a structured direction. Personally, i think its worth the investment to have someone hold your hand in the beginning and to ask questions to.

>On the other hand, now a days it’s actually recommended to leave any coding bootcamp experience OFF a resume. Many employers automatically disqualify you for having attended a bootcamp. (Because the market is SO full with bootcamp grads with little/no exp and nobody really fails/flunks out of these bootcamps even though they can be really challenging)

>What this means is you get what you put into it. If you work really hard, take the course seriously, try your best to learn amap, and don’t expect the “certificate” to mean anything you’ll learn the necessary skills and land a job fine. DON’T sign up if you’re hoping it’ll be another boost to your resume.

>One more thing, if you decide to continue the “teach yourself online” route check out Andrei Neagoie‘s complete web dev course on udemy.com (it goes on sale for $12-14 every few days) I use that course to review and it’s at least as good as the UT bootcamp, maybe better. There’s a lot of value being in class to have your questions answered right away, but because of COVID the next few UT cohorts will likely be remote.. and if you’re taking the class remotely you might as well signup for a tried and tested class for a fraction of the price. 🤷‍♂️

>Worst case scenario, the class doesn't do it for you, you’re out $12, and you have a good recap going into a bootcamp when you sign up.

>I don't regret taking the UT bootcamp, it was an excellent exp and was well worth the 7k. I’m not affiliated with either program, but if I could go back and do it again I would take the udemy course and build a bunch of websites/projects to show off in interviews.

**Q:**  If I do go the self-taught route and create "X" personal portfolio projects (Specific to front-end positions), is there anything that you know companies look for when hiring?

>**A:**  Generally, every companies are looking for:
1. Someone that can learn/pickup technologies fast. (Generally, people with work or CS experience)
2. They want people that are pleasant to work with. Personable, communication skills, friendly etc. You would be AMAZED how anti-social most technical/CS guys are.
3. Most importantly, they are looking for people that have experience and can build things with the technology/tools they currently use. 

**Q:** What you think of the other bootcamps compared to UT? Is there much of a difference, or is it mainly how hard you grind after hours?

>**A:** It will be hard for me to speak for other bootcamps as I only attended the one at UT.  When I compared prices with other bootcamps (4 years ago) it was several thousands of dollars cheaper. (Again, not sure about now)

**Q:**  How many hours did you work on projects a week?

>**A:** I spent six hours in class each day focused and hustling then stayed after class for an hour or so asking questions and talking to classmates.

**Q:** How experienced should you be with code prior?

>**A:** What experience SHOULD you start the bootcamp with? As much as you can manage I’d say. I went to school for electrical engineering and took some computer science classes then, so I had a huge leg up on people that went into the bootcamp blind. Going in with prior knowledge with absolutely help you get the most out of the experience as you’ll be able to spend more time on advanced things and less time playing catch up.

>That said, when i signed up they recommended i do some pre requisite work on Freecodecamp.org

>Time spent there will pay off ten fold^ Even if you only retain understand/half of it, it’s a great starting point. (Definitely at least work your way through the basic javascript section)

**Q:** How was your job search and opportunity after completion?  Was it all worth it?

>**A:** Applied for ~10 jobs after I “graduated”. Immediately got an interview with a place in DFW, bombed the interview because I didn’t understand Promises in JavaScript, and my employer hired me anyway for 70k. I started two weeks after the bootcamp and worked for that place for two years. Getting into development was the best decision of my life, so I would say it was worth it for me.
