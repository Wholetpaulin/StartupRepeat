### A Classic Fantasy Series:
The Wheel of Time is a juggernaut in the fantasy-fiction genre.  The epic story spans 14 books and two authors. (Robert Jordan passed before the release of book 12)  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this series, and can't wait to share my thoughts on it.    

### A Quick Summary Without Spoilers
The story follows a group of young adults from a backwater village that get involved in multiple epic adventures.  These adventures range from uncovering ancient weapons to rescuing princesses.  While these sound like cliche fantasy tropes, the dark-gritty setting that Jordan paints gives us a fresh perspective on what we already know and love.  

The main story revolves around magic and defeating the forces of evil. A prophecy states that one of our main characters will definitely go insane, make a great change in the world, and die fighting the said evil. 

## The Good
My favorite things about the Wheel of Time are the unique magic system, the marvelous plot, and the expansive world and cultures. Let's start with the magic system.

### The One Power
The one power is similar to the force in Star Wars.  *"It is the driving force of creation, it turns the wheel of time"* It's basically an invisible energy that only certain people (called channelers) can touch.  This magic power is split into two halves. *Saidin* is the male half and *Saidar* is the female half.  Each half of the power works differently, but the use of the male power is strictly forbidden across the world as it makes the users go insane. 

### The Plot
I will not be going into the details of the story so I don't spoil anything. That said, the plot is **by far** the strongest part of this series. There are exciting twists, epic battles, intrigue, saucy romances, and marvelous character developments.  I had several long nights with these books where I *could not* put them down until I found out what happened next.  If you can get past Jordan's slow paced writing style, you are certain to get hooked on the story.

### The Setting
Robert Jordan proves to be a masterful world-builder, and paints the setting in excruciating detail.  There are a wide range of distinct races, not all of which are human, which inhabit fantastic cities across the world.  Each race has its own unique culture, history, and quirks that make the wide cast of characters more familiar and relatable.  Each country that the characters visit is described like an entire new world.  

## The Bad and the Ugly
The weaker aspects of the series are the unimpressive villains, the overuse of plot armor, the poorly written female characters, and the slow writing style that Jordan often used to describe the setting.

### Slow Writing Style
This is the biggest turn off and the biggest complaint I hear from people I recommend these books to.  Robert Jordan does a wonderful job at painting the setting for us, but the problem is he's a slow painter.  He often goes into long-winded descriptions that don't add anything to the story.  For example, Jordan would spend **two pages** describing a side character, their backstory, their clothing, their facial expressions, and their mannerisms.  It's bad enough that fans of the series refer to parts of the later books as "*the slog*".

### The Forsaken (SPOILER Warning)
The forsaken are set up to be the most dangerous channelers in history with multiple lifetimes of experience.  However, throughout the story all they manage to do is bicker and fumble over one another.  Several of them get defeated easily, sometimes even by side characters.

### Plot Armor (SPOILER Warning) 
Three of the main characters are considered Ta'veren.  This means that reality bends around these characters until they complete their purpose.  Essentially, you can count on them not dying and eventually completing their goals.  Explained another way, the Ta'veren have plot armor that is written into the story and breaks the fourth wall.  Countless times throughout the series enemy attacks fail, allegiances change, and the plot flip-flops to accommodate these Ta'veren.  When it comes time to explain why something strange happened, the characters shrug and say, "Must be these Ta'veren."  I think this was a creative way to drive the narrative and explain away plot holes, but it left the story without much tension.  You knew these three characters were not only going to survive, but also would eventually win. (For the most part)

### Men Writing Women (SPOILER Warning) 
Right out of the gate, we learn that there are two halves for the one power, one for each gender.  This dichotomy sets up a major theme of the story that men are segregated from women.  Nothing in the story screams sexism, per say, but it's the combination of multiple weird things that make the story feel like it was written by a neck-beardy nice guy.  Here are some examples of things I found strange:
- Spankings given to women as punishment many times throughout the book.
- Every lead female character *requiring* a romantic partner.
- Men are stronger channelers than women.
- The way women are described to readers is objectifying. (Always the bosom & hips!)
- One female lead sexually assaulting another. (In a conjured nightmare) 
- A male lead getting continuously raped by a female side character. 
- Dangerous women collared and put on leashes.
- Women are manipulative and deceptive throughout the books. (Not just the Aes Sedai)  

The combination of all this gives the story undertones of sexism even if that wasn't Jordan's intention at the time.  These books are almost 30 years old now and it was a different time, but I can't help but see some parts of this story on the [r/MenWritingWomen](https://www.reddit.com/r/menwritingwomen/) subreddit. 
Let me point out, there *are* strong, likable female characters in the story.  My favorite character in the series is Nynaeve, so maybe I'm being overly critical. But the questionable stuff I mentioned above is *definitely* going to be left out of the show.

## Aside: An Upcoming TV-Series Adaptation
Amazon purchased the rights to make a Wheel of Time TV series, and is airing Season 1 in November (2021).  They obviously want to mimic the huge commercial success that we saw from HBO's Game of Thrones.  I've read the Song of Ice and Fire books and I've seen all of the HBO series.  That said, a well-done Wheel of Time show would blow Game of Thrones out of the water. The Wheel of Time is well written, engaging, and strong enough to stand on its own.  The question is will the writers deviate from the already successful story that Jordan laid out for them?  Too often we see arrogant producers/script writers think they can write fantasy better than established fantasy authors. I can't wait to see if this is the case in November.

## In conclusion
However the film adaptation turns out, the Wheel of Time will forever be one of my top fantasy series of all time.  It's unique, exciting, and a (mostly) wholesome read. If you find yourself stuck inside with too much time on your hands, I can guarantee this series will keep you busy and will not disappoint.
