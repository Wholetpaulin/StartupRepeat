## About The Project

Here's what to expect:
* A clean responsive website showing off my mad skillz :smile:
* Rambling blog posts about music, technology, media, and other random things.


### Built With

I tried to keep things as vanilla as possible, but **really** wanted to write blogposts in markdown. (So I used a few frameworks) [Here](https://www.startuprepeat.com/programming/how-this-website-was-built) is a post detailing exactly how I built the blog. This section lists any major frameworks/libraries I used to bootstrap this project.

* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
